# Teams Generator

# Description

For this challenge it was my job to start from scratch, and build a teams generator. This is a command
line interface application that asks the user to input data about their team. The generator uses jest
for testing and inquirer for gathering user input. Using javascript to format that data, the generator
then creates a formatted HTML file that displays the team and their corresponding information. The program
is started by running the command ``` node index.js ``` in the terminal. To run the tests, use the command
``` npm run test ```
